        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the original snow simulation paper, we finished all steps of the MPM method: rasterize the particle
            data to the grid, compute particle volumes and densities, compute grid forces, update velocities on grid,
            handle the grid-based collisions with the environment (i.e. the walls), update deformation gradient, update
            particle velocities, handle particle-based collision with the environment, and update particle positions.
            For simplicity, we ignored the implicit time-integration of velocities. We plan to add the implicit
            velocities in the future weeks.

        <h2>Preliminary Results</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Implemented our own data structure, including Grid, GridNode, Particle, SnowParticleMaterial, and
                shape.</li>
            <li>Implemented full material point method to simulate snow dynamics, including collision with grid and
                object.
            </li>
            <li>Achieved visualization simulating, simulating a snow ball exploding.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflection On Progress</h2>
        <p>
            We succeeded in implementing the baseline model. During the process, we ignored the implicit velocity update
            for simplicity and we plan to go back to it after we finish all implementation. We also plan to be able to
            create and combine multiple shapes of snow particle clusters in the future. Our goal was to be able to
            simulate easy snow behaviors by the end of the first stage.

        <h2>Update On Work Plan</h2>
        <p>We finished all the planned objectives before April 16, as listed in our proposal. Below is our updated plan
            for the next two weeks.

        </p>
        <p>Apr 16 - Apr 22</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Try to combine useful details from other methods to solve the simulation problems with MPM.</li>
            <li>Modify current implementation so we can add more snow (as in shapes of sphere, rectangular, etc)
                altogether in the simulation.
            </li>
            <li>Experiment with relatively more complicated simulation scenarios.</li>
            <li>Experiment with possible optimization methods if we have time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Apr 23 - Apr 30 (Due date)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work on our aspirational plan, if we finish the implementation from the paper ahead of time.</li>
            <li>Implement implicit time-integration on velocities.</li>
            <li>Implement particle to particle collision if we have time.</li>
            <li>Resolve possible lingering problems.</li>
            <li>Finish final report, record project videos/Demos and prepare for the presentation.</li>
        </ul>
