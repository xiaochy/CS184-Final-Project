        <h2>Abstract:</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, we employed the Material Point Method (MPM) to simulate snow behaviors. Our approach
            involved the development of a 3D grid-based system to manage the motion and interactions of individual snow
            particles. Initially, all particles are rasterized onto the grid mesh, enabling the computation of particle
            densities and volumes based on their respective gridnodes. Subsequently, if there is a collision between the
            snow object and its environment, we update relevant values of each gridnode to reflect the impact of the
            collision. Finally, we transfer the updated data from the grid back to the individual snow particles,
            allowing for the adjustment of their positions accordingly. We then create multiple scenarios with different
            material parameters to test on our implementation and see how the settings influence behavior of snow. Our
            code is based on OpenGL. We do all the experiments on Linux.

    <div id="Technical Implementation">
        <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
        The general idea is based on the paper “A material point method for snow simulation” (A. Stomakhin et al.,
        2012). Below includes the implementation details.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Structures</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>GridMesh:</b></li>This is our grid, which stores the basic information a grid contains: the
                    size of
                    the
                    grid in three dimensions, the number of GridNodes in three dimensions, and a vector of GridNodes. It
                    also
                    includes some other useful information, including a SnowParticleSet and a bounding box of the grid.
                    We
                    initialize the GridMesh and construct a vector of GridNodes based on the size of the bounding box
                    and the
                    size of each GridNode. The material point method is mainly implemented in this class.
                    <li><b>GridNode: </b></li>This represents each node on the GridMesh, containing key attributes
                    including a
                    GridNode's mass, velocity at the last timestep, velocity at the current timestep, index on the
                    GridMesh, and
                    the force applied on it.
                    <li><b>SnowParticle: </b></li>This structure is the snow particle on our screen. It has velocity,
                    mass,
                    density,
                    volume, material, FLIP velocity, PIC velocity, deformation gradients, weights of its surrounding
                    GridNodes,
                    and the singular value decomposition of its gradient. The FLIP and PIC are two grid-based techniques
                    to
                    simulate the fluid behavior. In MPM, we combined them to simulate to update each particle’s
                    velocity.
                    <li><b>SnowParticleSet:</b> </li>We store all the particles on the screen in a SnowParticleSet, and
                    it
                    contains a
                    maxVelocity attribute, which is a limit of the maximum velocity that each particle can achieve.
                    <li><b>SnowParticleMaterial:</b> </li>This structure specifies the material of a particle. It stores
                    a
                    number of
                    features the different materials would have. These features determine how the snow particles behave
                    when
                    colliding with the environment.
                    <li><b>SimDomain:</b> </li>This is where we do all the simulations. This simulator calls all 10
                    steps of
                    the snow
                    simulation listed in the paper, which are detailed below.
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Material point Method</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Step 1:</b> Build a grid and construct all grid nodes in the grid. Rasterize particle data to
                        grid
                        nodes.
                        Each particle affects its surrounding 64 nodes (4 in each direction). Properties such as
                        velocity and
                        mass are transferred from particles to those nodes.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 2: </b>Calculate the density and volume of particles by estimating each grid node's
                        density.
                        For each
                        particle, take the weighted mass of its neighboring nodes. Estimate a particle's density by
                        dividing the
                        accumulated node mass by node volume, ensuring the value of density is relative to the
                        properties of a
                        single node. Compute a particle's volume by dividing its mass by its estimated density.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 3:</b> Compute stress-based forces applied on grid nodes. Compute stress experienced by
                        snow
                        particles
                        under deformation considering both elastic and plastic stresses.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 4:</b> Update the explicit velocity of each grid node. Since the grid is never deformed
                        (the
                        grid
                        nodes' positions are always fixed), the velocity update represents the position update of
                        Eulerian grid
                        nodes. </li>
                    <li><b>Step 5:</b> Handle grid-based collisions. Though nodes are never moved, assume each node
                        moves a
                        small
                        distance from its fixed position with its current velocity in a timestep. Check if the node at
                        its
                        temporary position collides with the bounding box (the environment). Apply dynamic friction to
                        the
                        relative velocity and transform the relative velocity after collision back into world
                        coordinates.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Step 6:</b> Solve the linear system and calculate the implicit velocity update (PS: Since we
                        do not
                        have
                        enough time to implement this part, we simply set updated velocity of each node at the current
                        timestep
                        to explicit velocity).
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Step 7:</b> Update the deformation gradient. Compute the singular value decomposition of the
                        elastic
                        part of
                        the deformation gradient. Update both elastic and plastic components of the deformation gradient
                        based
                        on the SVD. \(F_{E_{p}}^{n+1} = U_{p} \Sigma_{p} V_{p}^{T}\) and \(F_{P_{p}}^{n+1} =
                        v_{p}\Sigma_{p}^{-1}U_{p}^{T}F_{p}^{n+1}\)
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Step 8:</b> Derive the FLIP velocity and PIC velocity of the particles by computing two
                        different
                        kinds of
                        weighted sum of grid node velocities. PIC velocity is purely based on grid node velocities at
                        the
                        current timestep, while FLIP velocity would rely on node velocities at the current timestep and
                        the
                        previous timestep. The particle's new velocity would be a weighted sum of the FLIP and PIC
                        velocities. <span>\(v_{p}^{n+1} = (1-\alpha)v_{{PIC}_{p}}^{n+1} + \alpha
                            v_{{FLIP}_{p}}^{n+1}\)</span></p>
                        (According to the paper, we usually choose alpha = 0.95).
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Step 9:</b> Handle the particle-based collision. This step is pretty similar to step 5,
                        except that
                        now we
                        work on the particle values. Again, check if the particle collides with the bounding box by
                        computing
                        its temporary position with its velocity. If collision happens, compute the relative velocity,
                        transform
                        back to the world space, and update the particle's velocity.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Step 10:</b> Finally, update each particle's position based on its updated velocity.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div id="Problems & How we solved them">
        <h2>Problems & How we solved them</h2>
        <li>Our rasterization of particles didn't behave as expected. Positions were updated incorrectly and the snow
            object stopped moving in the air. We spotted errors in our implementation of rasterization - we mistakenly
            reset node indices to zero each time while we should only reset properties like mass, velocity and force. We
            also revised the weighting of grid nodes so that it's computed correctly.
        </li>
        <li>The volume and density of particles were miscomputed at first. We found the wrong index of corresponding
            nodes, updating some particle densities to zero. This leads to infinite volumes. We solve this problem by
            revisiting the implementation, printing all particle values and testing places that could go wrong.
        </li>
        <li>Unexpected behavior of collision. At first we didn't take the normal force applied to particles when they
            collide with the surface into consideration. This caused the inability for our snow objects to stay on the
            ground. To address this issue we modified our step 4 which updates the velocity of grid nodes. We added the
            normal force to nodes on the surface (position on y-axis = 0) which combined with original gravity led to a
            zero net force. After modification our snow objects can stand still when no other forces are applied, and
            when dropped with a non-zero velocity the collision becomes more realistic.

    </li>
    <li>Incorrect update of node velocities. At first, we were trying to compute every node velocity at the previous
        timestep. However, this would lead to undefined velocity values, since the grid is much bigger than the snow
        object, which means not every grid node would have particles nearby.
    </li>
    <li>Optimization - we added a structure called effective nodes to the grid mesh, which contains all the relative
        nodes needed in iteration so we don't have to go through all the nodes. This speeds up our
        computation by a fixed amount, which is considerable when the scene is small (i.e. with fewer snow
        particles).

        <div id="Limitation">
            <h2>Limitation</h2>
            <li>Our project is run on our own computer. The rendering is slow, which results in choppy videos.
            </li>
            <li>We ignore the friction in air when the snow object is falling down.
            </li>
            <li>We ignores the implicit velocity update resulted from the elasto-plastic response.
            </li>
            <li>
                We attempted to implement a rolling snowball on the ground. We introduced a new function called
                <code>addParticlesInSphere()</code> to initialize all the particles' angular velocity and linear
                velocity. Initially, the snowball was rolling smoothly, but the snow particles appeared to disperse
                suddenly after a brief moment. Though we do not have enough time to fix it, the problem might
                be related to the collision with the bounding box. Our implementation
                handles the collision as long as the object touches the surrounding walls. However, in the rolling
                movement,
                there should not be upward velocity added on particles by the collision.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <li>We should write the design document before implementing the structures. When doing the project,
                    we
                    sometimes
                    found that we were confused with which values should be stored in each structure, and we spent
                    some
                    time
                    fixing our formatting after we finished implementing everything.</li>
                <li>We should write more comments, explaining what the code means and what we need to do next. We
                    wasted
                    some
                    time understanding our own codes since we forgot what we did before.</li>
                <li>Incorporating sanity checks during project implementation is crucial. We discovered that
                    debugging
                    multiple
                    components simultaneously was time-consuming and challenging. Had we conducted sanity checks
                    throughout,
                    we
                    could have pinpointed errors sooner, preventing them from escalating as we progressed.</li>

            <div id="Contribution">
                <h2>Contribution</h2>
                <p>We did most of the coding parts together. Below are details about each group member's
                    contribution.
                </p>
                <li><b>Claire Fang:</b> Claire contributed to the coding in Grid.cpp, fixed the formating of
                    the project, helped debugging and added comments explaining our codes. Claire also made the
                    milestone
                    video, made the slides and wrote most of the final report.</li>
                <li><b>Chuyang Xiao:</b> Work on the formula of material point method and organize the algorithm's
                    pipeline. Work
                    on
                    the code in Grid.cpp. Help debug segmentation fault and
                    weird snow behavior. Generate videos of some snow simulation and write part of the report.
                </li>
                <li><b>Yifan Yin:</b> Yifan put quite some efforts (which ended up in vain) trying to create an
                    interactive UI by modifying the one used in HW4. He met difficulties while creating the simulator
                    and the shader, which is the main reason that he gave up and we ended up using an already-existing
                    UI.
                    Apart from that, he wrote a small portion of the code for the physics model, and the optimization
                    method using effective grid nodes.
                    He also helped debugged
                    the code by fixing compile errors and
                    adding sanity checks to the code. </li>
